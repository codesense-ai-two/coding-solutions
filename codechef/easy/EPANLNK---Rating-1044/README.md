## Problem

### Efficient PAN Linking

There are $20$ officers in Chefland who can link the PAN to Aadhar.
$N$ applications were received for linking PAN. However, due to an internal conflict, each officer intends to process exactly the** same** number of applications.

Determine the** minimum** number of applications that would remain unprocessed.

Note that $N$ can be huge and might not fit in an integer.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $N$, denoting the number of applications.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the** minimum** number of applications that will remain unprocessed.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \lt 10^{100}$
### Sample 1:

```

```

19
```

### Explanation:

**Test case $1$:** Each officer would process $0$ applications and $1$ application would remain unprocessed.

**Test case $2$:** Each officer would process $1$ application and $35-20\cdot 1=15$ applications would remain unprocessed.

**Test case $3$:** Each officer would process $6$ applications and $127-20\cdot 6=7$ applications would remain unprocessed.

```cpp
import java.util.*;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();
        
        while (T-- > 0) {
            String n = sc.next();
            
            int rem = 0;
            for (char ch : n.toCharArray()) {
                rem = (rem * 10 + (ch - '0')) % 20;
            }
            
            System.out.println(rem);
        }
        
        sc.close();
    }
}
```
